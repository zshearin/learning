What is a boolean value?

What is an algorithm?

What is a loop?

What is a function?

what is a conditional?

what is the internet?


I am thinking that I should create a list of different topics to cover and cool projects related to those topics

example: binary numbers and sound.  Excerpt from the book I'm reading: "Computers produce sounds by translating binary numbers into electrical signals.  These electrical signals are then fed into a loudspeaker that makes a very thin sheet of metal vibrate.  The vibrations create pressure changes in the air that human ears interpret as sound"

Then with that do a project with the microbit where someone creates their own song (could also cover algorithms
